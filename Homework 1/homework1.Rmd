Matrix 5x5

```{r}
weights_in_pounds <- matrix(runif(25, min = 160, max = 200), nrow = 5)
```

Assigning months titles
```{r}
months <- c("Enero","Febrero","Marzo","Abril","Mayo")
colnames(weights_in_pounds) = months
```

Assigning names
```{r}
names <- c("Pedro","Pablo","Juan","Julio","Jose")
rownames(weights_in_pounds) = names
```

Getting average weights
```{r}
average_weight <- rowMeans(weights_in_pounds)

```

Adding averages to matrix
```{r}
weights_with_average <- cbind(weights_in_pounds, average_weight)
monthly_average_weight <- colMeans(weights_with_average)
weights_with_averageV2 <- rbind(weights_with_average, monthly_average_weight)
```

Showing result Matrix
```{r}
print(weights_with_averageV2)
```
